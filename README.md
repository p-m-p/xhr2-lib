XMLHttpRequest Level 2 Ajax library
===

*If you stumble across this project and use this library, as is, in any 
production code then may the sky fall on your head.*

Current state of this project
---

So this project is something I am building to progress my knowledge of the 
mechanics behind Ajax while getting up to speed with the new specifications
for the XMLHttpRequest object. The [XMLHttpRequest level 2][1] specification 
is still in draft and who knows, by the time it is finished and supported by 
all *modern* browsers I may have completed this library.
